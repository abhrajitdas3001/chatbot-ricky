## Course Description

In this hands-on course, technical content creator Ebenezer Don guides you through building an AI chat application using Next.js and OpenAI GPT models. Learn how to create a fully functional chatbot with features like conversation threading, message persistence, and real-time responses. The course emphasizes best practices in state management, API integration, and modern UI development. When you complete the course, you will have a production-ready AI chat application that showcases modern web development practices.

_See the readme file in the main branch for updated instructions and information._

## Setup

1. Add `openai_api_key` to `.env.local` for the chat model.
2. For web search (general knowledge questions), add `TAVILY_API_KEY` to `.env.local`. Get a free key at [Tavily](https://app.tavily.com/).
3. **TTS (text-to-speech):** Uses your existing `openai_api_key` with OpenAI's built-in voices. Choose a voice from the picker in the sidebar.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.
